Description: This package provides routines for PLS-based genomic
        analyses. It implements PLS methods for classification with
        microarray data and prediction of transcription factor
        activities from combined ChIP-chip analysis. The >=1.2-1
        versions include two new classification methods for microarray
        data: GSIM and Ridge PLS. The >=1.3 versions includes an other
        new classification method combining variable selection and
        compression in logistic regression context: RIRLS-SPLS; and
        an adaptive version of the sparse PLS.
